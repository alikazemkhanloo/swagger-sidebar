# swagger-sidebar

A simple sidebar to easily navigate through endpoints.

## Usage

just add this script:

```html
...
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-sidebar/lib/bundle.js"></script>
...
```

## How it works

it waits for the loading component to disappear and then uses querySelector to find the sections on the page. Then it renders a simple sidebar.
